<p><strong>What do you like best about this course?</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>I liked how the homework was relevant to the material we learned and how the professor made clear what he expected the students to know</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>He taught the subjects and problems very effectively showing step by step solutions. He did not go that fast but he was relatively slow with material because we are behind 4 chapters from the other Dif EQ classes.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The instructor was very clear and has a Good teaching pedagogy. Very professional!!!</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Lecture was very concise, straight to the point, and easy to understand.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I feel the professor is very knowledgeable in the material.</q></p></blockquote><hr>
<p><strong>If you were teaching this course, what you you do differently?</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>I would make the exams in the same format the material has been taught and as that of the homework </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Move the lesson faster, show various example, more partial credit and base points off of things learned instead of tiny details like the identification of an ODE</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Gave more graded homework.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I would have liked to be challenged more in the exams and quizzes in order to advance more intellectually. The course seemed to be setup for mass promotion.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Enhance exams by adding more questions. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>He needs to improve his exam quality/ content. He gave us an exam which he openly admitted we were not prepare to complete. I felt this was unfair. In addition, he also made errors on grading the same exam, which ultimately harmed my grade as well as others which had the same issue.

Another thing the professor should do is refrain from indirectly offending student&#039;s intelligence. This is an extreme turn off for students and in turn causes us to loose respect for him. IF he feels we don&#039;t know how to do something like evaluating limits, which is learned in lower levels of the math courses, he should take that into consideration and realize that it is natural for anyone to forget that skill; especially if it was learned 3 or more semesters ago.

I feel that we pay professors such as him to teach us and not offend us or make us feel inferior just because he has achieved (past tense)  a level of education that we are in the process of achieving (present tense). I believe this is unprofessional on his behalf as an educator and he should work on improving this aspect of his personality/ teaching style.</q></p></blockquote><hr>
<p><strong>In what ways, if any, has this course or the instructor encouraged your intellectual growth and progress?</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>Some things covered he either did briefly or not at all so learning the problems by yourself is a must for those subjects.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>In many ways. I could see my self as a genius in the engineering fields and express no regret of changing my major to engineer. I could see and feel the application of what he has taught in the engineering works place.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Not very much. The professor seemed very knowledgable, but deep thought and complex problems were rarely introduced in class. </q></p></blockquote><hr>
<p><strong>Other comments or suggestions.</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>His tests involved material we never covered in class and counted as a majority of the points. His problems on their tests are weirdly phrase from discussions in class and in the book. Solving the problems were unfamiliar almost completely from homework assignments and quizzes. His tests seem like they are not his at this point. Credit on problem on quizzes and exams are unfair because he takes off an entire point if you don&#039;t identify the equation despite solving it proving you know it is that specified identity. Tests and quizzes are scored unfairly. His tests are scores of 15 points with 2-3 problems that are not familiar with the course lesson problems. His quizzes are 5-10 points and again, takes off a lot of points if not identified completely despite solving the problem step by step. A calculation error results in a 20% off your score with his grading system. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The teacher is very professional, I would suggest that  he teach other Math class as well. I could see him as an excellent contributor in helping other students become excellent in their career!!!</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I would encourage challenging students more. This is a higher level mathematics course and if certain students cannot handle it, then they should not be in the class in the first place. Overall, the professor was very kind and helpful to any students who asked questions. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Putting down others is in no way a method of bringing yourself up.</q></p></blockquote><hr></div>
