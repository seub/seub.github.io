<p><strong>What do you like best about this course?</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>I really liked how we were given numerous practice problem for homework that helped us prepare for the quizzes and also having quizzes every week help me better remember the material </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The professor&rsquo;s lectures were helpful and all of the required information and equations were always given to us.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Learning about different dimensions. To me, it makes me feel like we are unlocking the secrets to the universe whenever we learn more about calculus.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Material was presented in a way that eas easy to digest and follow. The professor made sure that we understood what he was doing before moving on. The quizzes we&#039;re a good way to reinforce the material, and were the appropriate level of difficulty every time. This, along with the assigned homework problems, helped in preparing for bigger exams.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Mr. Loustau&#039;s very straight forward teaching methods are what I like about him the most. It is what I admired in a previous semester and the reason why I took his course again this semester. His grading methods are fair and reasonable and he gives plenty of homework to work on.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>He always draws the beautiful graphs on the blackboard. He is funny and makes the class interesting. He always gives us clear examples to help us understand the definition. He is great.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The instructor was well prepared and taught course material adequately with detailed examples to aid homework problems. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>This was an amazing Calculus experience, the instructor provided adequate instruction and encouraged student learning. The aspect I liked best about this course was the fact that the instructor was super organized throughout the class and provided well organized notes and ultimately struck a perfect balance between notes and examples!</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The teacher did well to understand where students may struggle most in learning the materials for the course. Therefore, utilized ample amount of time to ensure the desirable performance for both student and of course teacher.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Professor Loustau has an amazing gift for presenting the material in a clear and easily understandable way. He is also an incredible mathematician and extremely kind. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I love that the professor was methodical in his teaching and he build up to concepts in a structured way. He was also very accommodating in verbalizing everything that he did step by step.</q></p></blockquote><hr>
<p><strong>If you were teaching this course, what you you do differently?</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>Nothing </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Give more straight forward exam questions instead of having to give reasonings for everything. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>If we have days where school is canceled, making us behind in material, I would slightly decrease the amount of information taught for the remainder of the material instead of decreasing it tremendously for the material we would learn on those skipped days.  </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>If I were teaching the course, I would not make the students purchase the textbook because it was only used for practice problems and not as a referance.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I would push office hours more into the students and encourage more questions. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Nothing that I can think of.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I would spend some more time on examples. In class examples are the most crucial part of any math course. Having the professor go over how to do specific problems helps more than that lecture itself. It gives students a path to follow when they are stuck at home or during a test/quiz.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Maybe not. But I will give students less homework than he did. However, I have to say, it&#039;s useful. Maybe I will emphasis how to write the explanation during solving the problem. However, he did very good job, like him.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Reduce amounts of quiz through the semester and instead hold a 10-15 min homework review session from previous week to help students better understand material misunderstood through the instructor. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>If I were teaching this course I would make more math related comments that would generate a passionate interest in the course (similar to the fact stated about the 4D cubes/tesseract). Calculus is an amazing course and it is extremely interesting to talk about the theoretical physical properties of 4D objects.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>If I was teaching this course there is not much, than has already been done. Although the exam were a lot more conceptual than simply answering the problems word for word. I do realize that future math courses focus more on concepts of math and it derivations. Therefore, the professor is doing his best to prepare us for such course load.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Nothing. This course could not have been improved upon.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I would include 3-D objects.</q></p></blockquote><hr>
<p><strong>In what ways, if any, has this course or the instructor encouraged your intellectual growth and progress?</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>The quizzes every week encouraged my intellectual growth </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>As a mathematics major, this course aided in my knowledge to the subject and I leave the course with material that I had never seen before. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>It has encouraged me to finish the rest of my college career I&rsquo;m  actually excited to learn more mathematics. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Got me to see Calculus differently, namely more geometrically. I feel I have a different, more nuanced perspective on how to approach certain problems and understand certain concepts. The geometric focus that the professor gave me a way to visualize concepts as opposed to just memorizing formulas. And even with formulas I was able to understand more of how they are composed and why.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>N/A</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>He is nice, and always give us the instructions to solve the problems. He encouraged students to answer questions during the class, although I always typed my computer without answering. It&#039;s useful for us to know what other students think about. Therefore, we can avoid the mistakes during the exam. Like him a lot.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The instructor really does a good job in creating interest in course material which often helps with understanding previous Calc concepts and how they relate to our overall understanding of the material being taught. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Calculus is an amazing course that, with an understanding, teaches us the language of the universe. The material itself and the instruction provided by the instructor gave us an understanding of how the universe around us works.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The professor has encourage my intellectual growth through, the assignments, quizzes, and exams he gives. To successful solve the problems, there is need of a level of understanding that involves a more comprehensive understanding of the material than simply plugging in numbers to formulas.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Professor Loustau has shown me that even complicated math can be broken down into its core components and made easier to understand. I felt intimidated by Calculus 3 before I started this course, now I feel like i could take ANY math course offered and do well. My confidence in my math abilities has increased significantly. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The instructor was very accommodating and made improve my skills. </q></p></blockquote><hr>
<p><strong>Other comments or suggestions.</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>For homework assignment, If possible, the professor could put the correct answers online so students would know if they were doing the worl correctly and use the homework as a study guide. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Professor was really nice and cool. He knew what he was doing.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>None.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I felt the pace of the course was very quick. This was especially since we had 2 snow days and was forced to teach ourselves lessons for upcoming quizzes. I understand there is a lot to cover in not a lot of time and that if we had not kept pace because of the snow days we would not have been on time to finish, nevertheless it made the course that much harder and would cut into the time I had for other classes.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>No</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The exam problems were at times a little off from material covered in lecture, including hw, making it more difficult to approach problems. Secondly, some wording of quizzes and exams are confusing altering students to reconsider answers even if solved correctly. It would be beneficial to also consider giving a set of chosen review problems for exams to narrow down materials needed to study instead of materials not being covered. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I just can&#039;t overstate the fact that the notes provided and theessons taught were perfectly organized and balanced. The notes were easy to follow and to catch up with. Even after a 2 week leave from class (which I though would leave me far behind in this course) I was able to easily catch up on the notes because of the fact that they were extremely organized and thorough. It is extremely hard to find an instructor that gives great notes.</q></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><q>None.</q></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><q>The grading system is great! However, if I had to change it, I would give more points for right attempts and take off less points for minor numerical errors as long as the formulae and processes used at correct.</q></p></blockquote>
