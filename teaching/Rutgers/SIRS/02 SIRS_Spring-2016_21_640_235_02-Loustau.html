<p><strong>What do you like best about this course?</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>We can access assigned practice problems online. Also, he does a number of practice problems/examples in class</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I liked how much easier the material was from the first two calculus courses</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The teacher has a Good Teaching Pedagogy. He knows and masters the materials!!!</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>His lectures were understandable but not helpful for exams. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>N/A</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The homework assigned was helpful with understanding the chapters.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>he is ready respectful  but definitely he is not good teacher for this course.</q></p></blockquote><hr>
<p><strong>If you were teaching this course, what you you do differently?</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>I wouldn&#039;t do anything differently</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I wouldn&#039;t have assigned a graded homework assignment</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Gave more graded homework, so the students could have felt more engage for the class.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The professor&#039;s exams were not an appropriate level of difficulty! Neither the homework nor did the lectures prepare us enough for the exams. His exams were in an unfamiliar style and very difficult. Absolutly horrible professor. He refuses to curve regarless of the fact a large population of the class is recieving a 60% average. He must change his testing style. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>N/A</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I would give more homework problems that are more challenging and do more examples in class. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>i would definitely stop giving to much definition on note and start to do more example in class. also exam and quiz are really harder than what he teach, if he wants to give hard question on exam or test he must do the same hard question as  example in class.</q></p></blockquote><hr>
<p><strong>In what ways, if any, has this course or the instructor encouraged your intellectual growth and progress?</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>Find ways to apply these skills while pursuing my computer science major</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>He&#039;s encouraged me to not give up trying to reach a good grade even with a poor start</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>By asking us questions in the classroom in the sole purpose of making us learn the materials, that really helped us grasp a better understanding of the subject being discussed and let us build our ability to solve problems.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>His exams were very discouraging </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>N/A</q></p></blockquote><hr>
<p><strong>Other comments or suggestions.</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>Practice exams uploaded online</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I wish I could have done better</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The teacher knows his stuff !!! My love for math&#039;s has grown more and more and I could see the application of what he has taught in the engineering fields.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Either change his testing style or fire him from his professing position. Student academic performances are being severely affected because of him. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I suggest Professor Loustau makes the problems for this exams more straight forward and have less conceptual problems. Also, it is hard for most students to pass the tests because of the low total points. For example, on some quizzes, the total points one can get was 6/6. It is difficult to get a passing grade if 2 incorrect answers (4/6) would result to a low grade. 
It would also be nice if the professor provided his grading criteria in the first day of class, such as the percentages of exams, his grading range, etc. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>most of notation was different from book so it cause a huge problem when I try to read book and he didn&#039;t follow book order at all which make this course really confusing . exam was very hard compare to what he did in class. also asking definition question on math quiz or exam is not nice idea . in general he is not good choice to teach this course.  </q></p></blockquote><hr></div>
