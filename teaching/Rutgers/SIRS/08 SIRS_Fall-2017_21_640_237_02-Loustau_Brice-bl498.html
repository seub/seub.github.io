<p><strong>What do you like best about this course?</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>It is easy to tell that Prof. Loustau is very knowledgeable on the subject, and I feel that he was able to explain every concept in a way that was approachable and easy to grasp.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>He explains solutions and answers questions clearly and precisely. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>THe quizzes and exams were accurate in regards to what I learned in class . </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Having the two lowest quiz grades dropped.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The teaching method was really effective .</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I loved learning about the thorems behind mathematics and the high level of Lviv we were forced to use. I have learned a great deal in this course.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I enjoyed how he would include real life computer programming examples so I don&#039;t question the purpose of the course</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The importance of it all, it&#039;s the foundation of day to day math. We kind of take it for granted</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I found the material itself interesting, and the professor was very straightforward in teaching it. He  wasted no time, and while he had to move quickly it wasnt overwhelmingly quick. He wasn&#039;t able to give many examples with the time given, but each example was clear enough to understand the concepts.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>the chapter on Algorithms</q></p></blockquote><hr>
<p><strong>If you were teaching this course, what you you do differently?</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>be more specific with homework questions. Don&#039;t just assign us the whole chapter, its a waste of time. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Nothing. I think that Prof. Loustau did a great job</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Nothing</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Collect homework and grade it </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The quizzes were bit confusing and challenging.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I would have provided the students with more in class examples. And would have sticked to the book 100%. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I would make homework assignments mandatory for students to force them to understand the material.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>He taught it perfectly. Can&#039;t think of anything he could have done better</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Not much maybe be a little more cheery, but it is a morning class, even the students need to be more cheery, so that could have something to do with it.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>There isn&#039;t much that I would do differently. Only try to find a way to allow for slightly longer class times to allow for more wiggleroom with how many examples could be covered.</q></p></blockquote><hr>
<p><strong>In what ways, if any, has this course or the instructor encouraged your intellectual growth and progress?</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>Prof. Loustau has helped lay a solid foundation on which my future mathematics studies will be firmly supported.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>He&rsquo;s encouraged me to take homework seriously and practice as much as I can. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>To actually do the homework and review the notes for quiz and tests.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>This class has made me think about things in a whole new light regarding the theory behind how mathematics works and has led me to further appricate how beautiful math really is.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>If you did poorly on an exam he would write that you can do better and he knows if you prepared for a quiz or not</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>He related it to my major, computer science</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I like how the professor made it clear he wasn&#039;t going to curve scores at all. It made it clear that I had to put as much time and effort as I could to ensure I not only understood the material but implemented it well.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>This class has made me curious about algorithms. Which I plan to look into further.</q></p></blockquote><hr>
<p><strong>Other comments or suggestions.</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>Great teacher. Learned a great deal!</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>More in class examples. Also it would be better if 100% of the exam was based on the book, seeing as we don&#039;t get many in class examples. Especially when it comes to the &quot;level of difficulty&quot; of an algorithm. Not many in class examples for it, and it was technically non existent in the book. And yet it was a great portion of the quizzes and exams. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I took this class as a finance major with a minor in math, this class is not a requirement to complete my minor, I took it because I was genuinely interested in the course and overall I was very pleased I took it.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Very friendly guy. One of the best professors I&#039;ve encountered at Rutgers</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>None.</q></p></blockquote><hr></div>
