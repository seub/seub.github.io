<p><strong>What do you like best about this course?</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>N/A</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Content </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The instructor is highly familiar with the material and sincere with explanations, he would sometimes talk about the historical background of famous mathematicians and their marvelous contributions to the field of mathematics. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I found the solutions to the various types of differential equation fairly interesting. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I liked that the professor was very organized with his notes as well as his availability through email. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I liked the emphasis on definitions. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I like the organization of the lecture, it was easy to follow and to refer to. </q></p></blockquote><hr>
<p><strong>If you were teaching this course, what you you do differently?</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>N/A</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I would give students a better study guide for the exams, as the material is very difficult. OR, curve the final grades fairly. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Regarding the quizzes, I felt that they took up too much class time and were given, at times, before we could review the subject matter from the previous class. It might have been more beneficial to assign homework assignments to be collected and graded.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Make quizzes shorter</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I would move faster in the class in order to cover more material(this would unfortunately effect how thorough he would be able to teach the material). I feel like we didn&#039;t get as far as I would have thought. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I would focus a little less on theory and give more examples that would prepare us for those we were being tested on. I would also give a review sheet, and if given a review sheet, one with answer so that we could review our work. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The quizzes and homework need to match the difficulty of the exams. For some reason, the quizzes and homework were easier in comparison to the exam and did not help me prepare for the test.</q></p></blockquote><hr>
<p><strong>In what ways, if any, has this course or the instructor encouraged your intellectual growth and progress?</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>N/A</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I like analytics now </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>He covered things such as Euler&#039;s formula which we never went over previously. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>N/A</q></p></blockquote><hr>
<p><strong>Other comments or suggestions.</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>N/A</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The instructor was very rigorous when it comes to grading, but we as mathematicians agree with that.  </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Enjoyable class. I found the class to move slower than I would have liked which made it a challenge to focus. I realize though that everyone learns at a different pace so it is a bit selfish of me to expect it to be catered to just me. Overall, I would definitely recommend your class to anyone interested in Differential Equations. Especially someone interested in the details. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The professor&#039;s grading was rather hectic. Point values were too high, and he focused a bit too much on theory. It felt moreso that this course was an English class rather than a math class. I didn&#039;t feel prepared for exams after his classes, and especially even after studying a lot on my own. Getting one question wrong for example could take us from passing to failing in an instant. Exams also had too few questions, so if you got one wrong you could get a low grade. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Please make the quizzes and homework on similar difficulty.</q></p></blockquote><hr></div>
